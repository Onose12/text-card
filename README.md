# text-card
Did I just hear someone say day 7? You are right. Its my 7th day of coding. (I now have 7 days experience in HTML and CSS. LOL!). Today l learnt more about applied visual design- how to use strong tag to make bold, 'u' tag to underline, 'em' tag to italicize, 's' tag to strikethrough text, 'hr' to create horizontal lines, how to adjust background-color, size of heading elements, how to add a box-shadow, decrease the opacity of an element and how to use the text-transform.
Practiced using a text card. Please CHECK IT OUT.
Thank you for reading.
